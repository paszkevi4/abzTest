To style my page I decided to use Sass and separated it into modules for each component and one module for common styles.
To deal with REST API axios has been applied. 1 POST(registration) and 3 GET(users, positions, token) requests were implemented by axios.
Redux was applied for state managment.

Tooltips, overflow and linebreaks were implemented in Our cheerful users component.
Also overflow was implemented in every component contains text.
Register component is customized with input validation and custom radiobuttons.

It took me about 20-25 hours to get this work done.
